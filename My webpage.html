<img src="Painting.jpeg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block">
<p id="para1" style="color:red;">Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface.
The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, 
and airbrushes, can be used. In art, the term painting describes both the act and the result of the action. 
The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls, paper, canvas, wood, glass, lacquer, pottery, leaf, 
copper and concrete, and the painting may incorporate multiple other materials, including sand, clay, paper, plaster, 
gold leaf, and even whole objects. Painting is an important form in the visual arts, bringing in elements such as drawing, 
composition, gesture, narration, and abstraction. Paintings can be naturalistic and representational, photographic, abstract, 
narrative, symbolistic, emotive or political in nature.</p>

<h2 id="pottery" style="color:springgreen;">Pottery</h2>
<img src="Pottery.jpg" class="rounded float-start">
<p style="color:teal;">Pottery is the process and the products of forming vessels and other objects with clay and other ceramic materials, 
which are fired at high temperatures to give them a hard, durable form. Major types include earthenware, stoneware and 
porcelain. The place where such wares are made by a potter is also called a pottery. The definition of pottery used by 
the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), is "all fired ceramic wares that contain clay when formed, except 
technical, structural, and refractory products." In archaeology, especially of ancient and prehistoric periods, "pottery" 
often means vessels only, and figures of the same material are called "terracottas." Clay as a part of the materials used 
is required by some definitions of pottery, but this is dubious.</p>
<h2 id="sketch"style="color:purple;">Sketch</h2>
<img src="Sketch.jpg" class="rounded float-end">
<p style="color:rebeccapurple;">A sketch is a rapidly executed freehand drawing that is not usually intended as a finished work. A sketch may serve a 
number of purposes. It might record something that the artist sees, it might record or develop an idea for later use or it 
might be used as a quick way of graphically demonstrating an image, idea or principle. Sketches can be made in any drawing medium. 
The term is most often applied to graphic work executed in a dry medium such as silverpoint, graphite, pencil, charcoal or pastel. 
It may also apply to drawings executed in pen and ink, digital input such as a digital pen, ballpoint pen, marker pen, water colour 
and oil paint. The latter two are generally referred to as "water colour sketches" and "oil sketches". A sculptor might model three-dimensional 
sketches in clay, plasticine or wax.</p>
